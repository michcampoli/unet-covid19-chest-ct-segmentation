# unet-covid19-chest-ct-segmentation
Developed a deep neural network based on UNet architecture that can accurately segment and quantify lung lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection from CT images with variable disease severity.
The Grand Challenge organization created a public platform "The COVID-19 Lung CT Lesion Segmentation Challenge 2020 (COVID-19-20)" to evaluate emerging AI methods for the segmentation and quantification of lung lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection from CT images. Datasets were provided by the Grand Challenge organization. The training and validation datasets contain unenhanced chest CT images and annotations of COVID-19 lesions from 120 and 50 patients, respectively. The test set has 79 patients.
